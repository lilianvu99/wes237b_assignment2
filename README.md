# WES-237B Assignment 2
## Part 1
* Include sample output of your program
## Part 2
* Include sample output of your program
* Provide a copy of your
    * Original image
    * Resized, greyscale image
    * OpenCV DCT result
    * Naive DCT result
    * 1D DCT result
* Use the time command to report how long each of the OpenCV, Naive, and 1D approaches take to execute (remember to remove the image display / keypress wait!).
## Part 3
* Include sample output of your program
* Compare the performance of your function to library implementation.
* Use any benchmarks covered from WES237A (please mention PMU) to clearly describe in what ways each function is better than the others.
## Part 4
* Include sample output of your program
* For each algorithm (Naive and Separable with and without LUTs; Matrix Multiplication, Block Matrix Multiplication), use perf to report on the cycle count, cache misses, and L1 cache.
* Extra Credit: Report on at least 2 additional metrics from perf. Explain what these metrics measure and why they are the same/different for each algorithm.
* For the Separable, MM, and BMM implementations, experiment with various sizes. No need to do so for the Naive implementation as it will take a significant amount of time.
* You may need to change the FRAME_NUMBER to see a noticeable difference in some of the optimizations. Feel free to experiment.
